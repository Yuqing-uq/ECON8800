#   Regressing the average wage series for highschool dropout and some college group on the 
# wage series for high school graduates and for college graduates over the 1963 - 1987 period.
#   The regression results suggest that one person with some college is equivalent to a total
# of 0.65 of a high school graduate and 0.30 of a college graduate, while a high school dropout
# is equivalent to 0.91191 of a high school graduate and -0.06 of a college graduate. 
#   Running the regression of highschool - college wage gap on the supply ratio and time series
# gives the coefficients of -1.373 on the supply and 0.076 on the time series, the constant is 
# -2.84. The standard error for the supply is 0.427 and 0.020 for the time series variable. 
# All te coefficients are aignificant at the 0.001 level.
# Therefore, the equation is,
#
#     log(w1/w2) = -1.373 log (x1/x2) + 0.076 time + comstant,
#                  (0.427)              (0.020)
#
#   The results is different from the results in the paper. One reason is the difference in
# classifying different educational level. Another reason is the difference in calculating the
# wage gap. In this regression, I use the wage gap results from problem set 2, however, the wage
# gap series is not exactly the same as the wage series in the paper. Therefore, the coefficients 
# might also be different.
